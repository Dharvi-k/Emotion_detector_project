# Emotion_detector_project
A basic Convolutional Neural Network-based emotion detection system built with PyTorch. 
This project was built from scratch as an early exploration into emotion detection using deep learning. While the testing accuracy currently reaches around 65%, the results are not yet fully reliable. Weâ€™ve started experimenting with transfer learning to improve performance, and this is just the beginning.
