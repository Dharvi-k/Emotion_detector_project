# Emotion_detector_project
A basic Convolutional Neural Network-based emotion detection system built with PyTorch. 
This project was built from scratch as an early exploration into emotion detection using deep learning. While the testing accuracy currently reaches around 65%, the results are not yet fully reliable. Weâ€™ve started experimenting with transfer learning to improve performance, and this is just the beginning.

## Dataset

This project uses the FER2013 facial emotion dataset from Kaggle.  
Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

Please download it manually from the link below:

ðŸ”— [FER2013 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

After downloading, extract the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder (`train/`, `test/`, etc.) as expected by the code.
